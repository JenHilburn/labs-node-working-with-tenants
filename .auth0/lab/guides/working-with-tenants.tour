      "description": "## Create a new tenant\n\nWe'll create a few different tenants to reflect a standard Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment (CICD) environment. These typically contain environments for development, staging (or testing), and production.\n\nTo get started, make sure you're logged in to your Auth0 account, then:\n\n1. #### Go to the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com).\n1. #### In the top left-hand corner of your dashboard, locate and click the dropdown menu that lists your tenants. \n1. #### Now, select the _\"Create a tenant\"_ option.  \n    ![select create a tenant](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/tenants-0.gif)  \n    The following screen should look familiar. You filled it out to create your _labs-_ tenant. Note that the Development tag is selected by default. All new tenants default to development environments.  \nLet's try to create a tenant with Auth0 in the domain name and see what happens.\n1. #### Try changing the tenant name to _Auth0_. \n    You should see an error message:  \n    ![try changing the name to auth0](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/auth0/labs/ilt/restricted-name-50.gif)  \n    Auth0 itself uses the Auth0 domain. Tenant names are global and unique. Even if you delete a tenant, the name cannot be reused in the future, so make sure you name tenants carefully. \n1.  #### Go ahead and type a new tenant name with the prefix \"dev-lab-\" with something unique at the end. \n    I'll abbreviate \"May The Force Be With You\" for mine (dev-lab-mtfbwy)\n1. #### Now, take a closer look at regions:\n    This is where your tenant data will reside and will affect your tenant’s URL. \n    Auth0 defaults to the _US_ Region.  \n    1. #### Click on _EU_. Notice how the Tenant domain URL changes to _.eu.auth0.com_.  \n    1. #### Now click _AU_ and note the URL is now _.au.auth0.com_. Click back on _US_.  \n1. #### Finally, click the _Create_ button.  \n    ![select create](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/auth0/labs/ilt/region-select.gif)  \n    After a few seconds, the page should refresh to display your new tenant as the active tenant listed in the top-left corner dropdown-menu.  \n1. #### You'll be greeted by a page like the one below. For our purposes, select the _\"I have used Auth0 before\"_ option, then select the _Get Started_ button.\n    ![select used before](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/auth0/labs/ilt/new-exp.png)"

This guide is designed to walk new users through each of the primary features needed to use Auth0 effectively. Since we're doing that right now through this lab, let's go ahead and hide that guide. \n\n1. #### Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the \"_Hide this_\" link located in the blue box on the right side of the page.  \n    ![select hide this](https://cdn.auth0.com/website/a0fun/v2/tenants-3.png)    \n    The Activity Dashboard is displayed and a prompt in the upper right-hand corner will let you know how to access the _Getting Started_ page.    \n1. #### The page will reload without the getting started guide. Dismiss any prompts.\n1. #### Locate your profile image in the upper right hand corner of the page and click it.\n    Note that the _Getting Started_ page is available here, along with relevant settings for your user account.
